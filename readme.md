# 🚀 FOP – Fundamentals of Programming (Complete Semester Repository)

Welcome to this repository.  
This repository is created to store **all Fundamentals of Programming (FOP) content** that I will study during my semester. It includes **lecture codes, concepts, practice programs, and extra examples**, all in one place.

Think of this repo as a **central hub** for everything related to FOP. If a lecture is missed, a concept feels confusing, or revision is needed before exams, this repository should have the answer.

This is my backup brain.

## 🎓 Lectures, Examples, and Practice

Every concept taught in lectures will be reflected here with:
- lecture-based code
- simple illustrative examples
- slightly advanced variations for better understanding

This helps bridge the gap between what is written quickly on the board and what actually makes sense when you sit down to code calmly.

## 🎉 A Little Fun Along the Way

Programming does not have to be boring.  
Some light humor and fun examples are included to keep things enjoyable.

```c
while(brain == "confused") {
    drinkTea();
    searchOnline();
    tryAgain();
}
